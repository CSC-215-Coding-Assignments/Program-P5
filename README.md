/**
** This program takes theta (n^4) running time
** for every row, every value in that row in every column is visited in the matrix 
** then for the second matrix, for each row, every value in all the columns in that row are visited
** the time it takes to visit all the values in one matrix is n^2 
** the time it takes to visit all the values in the second matrix is n^2
** multiplied together because the algorithm uses four nested for loops is n^4
** the actual comparisons itself and the incrementing of the variables I use take constant time
